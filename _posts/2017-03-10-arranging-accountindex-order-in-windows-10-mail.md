The [Mail and Calendar](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfhvqm" target="_blank) app in Windows 10 lacks the ability to rearrange account/inbox order for some reason (definitely _not_ a design oversight since it's been 2 years). It also doesn't order the account by alphanumeric (unlike apps such as Microsoft Authenticator), but simply by the time the account was added.

To workaround this limitation, we can use the Linked Inbox feature. It's pretty straightforward to do with only two inboxes (link them, unselect the inbox you want appearing last), so here are the steps for arranging 3 or more inboxes:

1. Link all the inboxes.
1. Unselect the inboxÂ you want appearing second.
1. Unselect the inbox you want appearing third.
1. So on and so forth, until you unselect the inbox you want appearing last.
1. The Linked Inbox disappears, with the inbox you want appearing first magically staying on top.
