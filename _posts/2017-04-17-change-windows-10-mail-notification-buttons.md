A while ago the default buttons in the notifications from the [Mail and Calendar](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfhvqm?ocid=9wzdncrfhvqm_ORSEARCH_Bing" target="_blank)Â app in Windows 10 were changed from Set flag/Delete and Set flag/Archive. What was also changed was the default actions of swipe right and swipe left, also from Set flag/Delete and Set flag/Archive.

Strangely, there is no Notification setting will change what the buttons do. To change what the two buttons do, change the Quick Actions settings. Swipe right maps to the left button in notifications, and swipe left maps to the right button.
