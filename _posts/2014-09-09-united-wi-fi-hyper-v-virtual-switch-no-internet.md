Apparently United Wi-Fi (the satellite based one by Panasonic) doesn't play well with Hyper-V's Virtual Switch. It will show you as purchased and signed in, but would not let you access the Internet. So before connecting to United Wi-Fi, make sure to change the Wi-FIÂ Virtual Switch from external to private.
