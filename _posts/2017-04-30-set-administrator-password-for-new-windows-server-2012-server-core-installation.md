So I have spent the last 2 hours figuring out how to get pass the **Enter new credentials for Administrator **screen on a newly installed Windows Server 2016 Server Core.

After entering the new password, the process just seemed to stuck and wouldn't let me confirm the password no matter how many times I have hit **Enter** on how many keyboards:

Eventually I came across [this blog post](https://mikaelfalkvidd.com/category/windows)Â - you are supposed to hit the **down arrow key** to move the cursor to **Confirm password**. Who knew?

With text-based UI like this, Microsoft really should stick with GUI.
